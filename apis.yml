  The U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) is an independent federal agency that
  oversees a network of media organizations aimed at providing news and
  information to audiences around the world. These media outlets, which include
  Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Middle
  East Broadcasting Networks, operate in multiple languages and regions to
  promote freedom of the press, democratic values, and access to objective news.
  The USAGM plays a critical role in countering disinformation and propaganda in
  countries where freedom of the press is limited, and serves as a vital source
  of accurate and unbiased news for millions of people worldwide. The agency is
  funded by the U.S. government and operates under the guidance of a bipartisan
  board of governors.
